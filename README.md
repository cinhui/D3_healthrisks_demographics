The data set used is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: 
<a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml">
https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml</a>, 
which contains data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state.

Each state is represented by a circle element with the state abbreviations in the circle.
Demographic variables are on the x axis and risk factors on the y axis.

Users can decide which data to display by clicking on the x axis and y axis labels.
The circle locations and axes are updated as needed.
When the user hovers the cursor over the circle element, the tool tip displays the data values.

Note: Use python -m http.server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser.
